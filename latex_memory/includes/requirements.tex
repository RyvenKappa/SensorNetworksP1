            \hline
            GR3 & The system starts in TEST MODE and changes from one operating mode to the next one (TEST – NORMAL ADVANCED - TEST...) by pressing the blue button B1 on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 board in a circular way. & Y\\

            TM3 & The system sends every 2 seconds all the measured values to the computer (using the USB virtual COM port of the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 board). & Y\\
            \hline
            TM4 & The RGB LED should be coloured in the dominant colour detected by the colour sensor. & Y\\

            NM7 & Limits for every measured variable (temperature, humidity, ambient light, soil moisture, colour and acceleration) should be fixed.
