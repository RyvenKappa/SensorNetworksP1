# Repository for the Project 1 of the Sensor Networks course

## _Introduction_

This project aims to extend the functionalities of a previous designed system that obtains biological data and gps location of a plant with communications with LoRaWAN.

## _Previous project_

This project is based on a solution developed using a DISCO-L072CZ-LRWAN1, with some sensors. More on that in this repository: https://github.com/RyvenKappa/EPCIoT_Final_Project
